  "text": "Charles James Kirk, born October 14, 1993, in Arlington Heights, Illinois, was an American right-wing political activist, entrepreneur, and media personality who died by assassination via gunshot on September 10, 2025, in Orem, Utah at the age of 31. He is best known as the co-founder and executive director of the conservative organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA), which he established in 2012. Kirk rose to prominence through campus debates, initiatives such as the Professor Watchlist, and mass rallies aimed at engaging young voters in conservative politics. He also published books and hosted 'The Charlie Kirk Show,' a talk radio program. His work with TPUSA extended to the creation of affiliate groups like Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith, the latter in partnership with Pentecostal pastor Rob McCoy, aligning him with the Christian right and Christian nationalism. A staunch ally of Donald Trump, Kirk was a prominent voice within the MAGA movement and became known for his conservative stances, including opposition to abortion, gun control, DEI programs, and LGBT rights. He also held controversial views, such as criticism of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Martin Luther King Jr., and was known to promote COVID-19 misinformation, false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 election, and the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. He briefly attended Harper College before dedicating himself full-time to political activism. Kirk was married to Erika Frantzve in 2021 and had two children. At the time of his death, Kirk was speaking at a TPUSA public debate event at Utah Valley University. His assassination garnered international attention and condemnation of political violence, leading to him being considered an icon of modern American conservatism.",
