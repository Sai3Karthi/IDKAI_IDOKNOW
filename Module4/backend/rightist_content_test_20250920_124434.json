Yukari Mitsuhashi explains. For Japanese workers in big cities, a typical work day begins with a state called sushi-zum e, a term which likens commuters squeezed into a crowded train car to tightly packed grains of rice in sushi. Essentially, ikigai is the reason why you get up in the morning The stress doesn’t stop there. The country’s notorious work culture ensures most people put in long hours at the office, governed by strict hierarchical rules. Overwork is not uncommon and the last trains home on weekdays around midnight are filled with people in suits. How do they manage? The secret may have to do with what Japanese call ikigai . There is no direct English translation, but it’s a term that embodies the idea of happiness in living. Essentially, ikigai is the reason why you get up in the morning. You may also like: Can you work yourself to death? Is this the secret to Swedish success? ‘ We had to give them bonuses’ to leave early To those in the West who are more familiar with the concept of ikigai, it’s often associated with a Venn diagram with four overlapping qualities: what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. Alamy Rush hour crowds in a state of sushi-zume at Shinjuku station in Tokyo (Credit: Alamy) For Japanese however, the idea is slightly different. One’s ikigai may have nothing to do with income. In fact, in a survey of 2,000 Japanese men and women conducted by Central Research Services in 2010, just 31% of recipients considered work as their ikigai. Someone’s value in life can be work – but is certainly not limited to that. A closer look In a 2001 research paper on ikigai, co-author Akihiro Hasegawa, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at Toyo Eiwa University, placed the word ikigai as part of everyday Japanese language. It is composed of two words: iki , which means life and gai, whichdescribes value or worth. According to Hasegawa, the origin of the word ikigai goes back to the Heian period (794 to 1185). “ Gai comes from the word kai (“shell” in Japanese) which were deemed highly valuable, and from there ikigai derived as a word that means value in living.” There are other words that use kai: yarigai or hatarakigai which mean the value of doing and the value of working. Ikigai can be thought of as a comprehensive concept that incorporates such values in life. There are many books in Japan devoted to ikigai, but one in particular is considered definitive: Ikigai-ni-tsuite (About Ikigai), published in 1966. The book’s author, psychiatrist Mieko Kamiya, explains that as a word, ikigai is similar to “happiness” but has a subtle difference in its nuance. Ikigai is what allows you to look forward to the future even if you’re miserable right now. Japanese people believe that the sum of small joys in everyday life results in more fulfilling life as a whole Hasegawa points out that in English, the word life means both lifetime and everyday life. So, ikigai translated as life’s purpose sounds very grand. “But in Japan we have jinsei, which means lifetime and seikatsu, which means everyday life,” he says. The concept of ikigai aligns more to seikatsu and, through his research, Hasegawa discovered that Japanese people believe that the sum of small joys in everyday life results in more fulfilling life as a whole. A concept for longevity? Japan has some of the longest-living citizens in the world – 87 years for women and 81 for men , according to the country’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Could this concept of ikigai contribute to longevity? Author Dan Buettner believes it does. He's the author of Blue Zones: Lessons on Living Longer from the People Who’ve Lived the Longest, and has travelled the globe exploring long-lived communities around the world, which he calls “ blue zones ”. One such zone is Okinawa, a remote island with a remarkably high number of centenarians. While a unique diet likely has a lot to do with residents’ longevity, Buettner says ikigai also plays a part. Getty Images Pop idol grannies from KBG84 perform at a herb garden on Kohama Island, Okinawa Prefecture (Credit: Getty Images) “Older people are celebrated, they feel obligated to pass on their wisdom to younger generations,” he says. This gives them a purpose in life outside of themselves, in service to their communities. According to Buettner, the concept of ikigai is not exclusive to Okinawans: “there might not be a word for it but in all four blue zones such as Sardinia and Nicoya Peninsula, the same concept exists among people living long lives.” Buettner suggests making three lists: your values, things you like to do, and things you are good at. The cross section of the three lists is your ikigai. But, knowing your ikigai alone is not enough. Simply put, you need an outlet. Ikigai is “purpose in action,” he says. For 92-year-old Tomi Menaka, her ikigai is to dance and sing with her peers in the KBG84 dance troupe, she told the Mainichi newspaper . For others, it might be work itself. Take action In a culture where the value of the team supercedes the individual, Japanese workers are driven by being useful to others, being thanked, and being esteemed by their colleagues, says Toshimitsu Sowa, CEO of HR consulting firm Jinzai Kenkyusho. CEO of executive recruiting firm Probity Global Search Yuko Takato spends her days with highly qualified people who consider work as their ikigai and, according to Takato, they all have one thing in common: they are motivated and quick to take action. “If you want to start a company but you are scared to dive into the unknown, go and see someone who is already doing something similar to what you have in mind.” By seeing your plans in action, Takato says, “it will give you confidence that you can do it too”. Getty Images Young salarymen (office workers) leave an office building in Tokyo (Credit: Getty Images) Think smaller That’s not to say that working harder and longer are key tenets of the ikigai philosophy – nearly a quarter of Japanese employees work more than 80 hours of overtime a month , and with tragic outcomes – the phenomenon of karoshi (death from overwork) claims more than 2,000 lives a year. Ikigai is about feeling your work makes a difference in people&rsquo;s lives Rather, ikigai is about feeling your work makes a difference in people’s lives. How people find meaning in their work is a topic of much interest to management experts. One research paper by Wharton management professor Adam Grant explained that what motivates employees is “doing work that affects the well-being of others” and to “see or meet the people affected by their work.” In one experiment, cold callers at the University of Michigan who spent time with a recipient of the scholarship they were trying to raise money for brought in 171% more money when compared with those who were merely working the phone. The simple act of meeting a student beneficiary provided meaning to the fundraisers and boosted their performance. This applies to life in general. Instead of trying to tackle world hunger, you can start small by helping someone around you, like a local volunteering group. Diversify your ikigai Retirement can bring a huge sense of loss and emptiness for those who find their ikigai in work. This can be especially true for athletes, who have relatively shorter careers. Getty Images Retirement caused champion hurdler Dai Tamesue to re-think the role work played in his life and identity (Credit: Getty Images) Champion hurdler Dai Tamesue, who retired in 2012, said in a recent interview that the fundamental question he asked after he retired was: “what was it that I wanted to achieve by playing sports?” “For me, what I wanted to achieve through competing in track and field was to change people’s perceptions”. After retiring, he started a company that supports sports-related business. Tamesue’s story shows the malleable nature of ikigai and how it can be applied. When retirement comes, it is helpful to have a clear understanding of why you do what you do beyond collecting a payslip. By being mindful of this concept, it might just help you live a more fulfilling life.",

Take, for example, the DS X e-tense, a \"2035 dream car\" produced by the French luxury brand DS. Half open-topped sports car, half luxury saloon, its outlandish styling looks as though it has come straight from the pages of a superhero magazine. Inside, it's no less radical - there's even a holographic personal assistant. It is designed to show what the company thinks a hugely powerful, all-electric self-driving machine might actually be like. DS Automobiles The DS X e-tense looks worthy of a fantasy comic superhero It bears little relation to anything the brand currently produces, but that is hardly the point. Some of its radical styling is expected to make it on to a new road-going car that will be unveiled later this year. Other ideas will feed into future designs, and provide a road map for technical research. \"A concept car is a development accelerator,\" explains DS design director Thierry Metroz. Its role, he says, is to \"test the new technologies that we imagine for the future, and accelerate their development\". Some concepts are a clear statement of intent. Three years ago, Porsche stole the headlines at the Geneva Motor Show with the Mission E - a concept for a fast, high-powered, long-range electric car. There was an error This content is not available in your location. Porsche Mission E The reaction, from press and public, was very positive. As a result, the German marque will begin production of a real-world electric sportscar, the Taycan, in 2019. Prototypes like this take ideas that are already relatively well developed, and put them into a public arena to test reactions. Others have a life beyond the shows. The 1955 Lincoln-Mercury Futura, for example, starred in a Hollywood movie, and eventually became a Batmobile in the 1960s Batman TV series. Getty Images The 1955 Lincoln-Mercury Futura inspired the design of Batman's original Batmobile Making sense of change is a common theme among concept car designers at the moment. For generations car companies have been focused on making petrol or diesel models that appeal to individual drivers. But the current move towards electrification, the headlong development of self-driving technology and the likely expansion of shared use vehicles , potentially threatens the very existence of traditional manufacturers. If we really are heading for a world where city dwellers - at least one day - rely on electric-powered robot taxis to get around, car brands will have to adapt or face extinction as their traditional business models collapse. Will we want to use cars inside our homes in future? Renault has chosen to address this uncertainty by embracing it. The French manufacturer has produced a whole fleet of concepts, offering different perspectives on this electrified, automated future. They include a car which actually becomes part of your living room, a large robot-taxi designed to transport a large group of people at once, and an automated delivery van. At the Paris Motor Show recently, it launched the EZ-Ultimo, a sleek driverless luxury limousine with wooden floors, and styling modelled on the radical Prada store building in Tokyo. It certainly looks striking. CHRISTOPHE ARCHAMBAULT Renault's EZ-Ultimo is designed to show that driverless cars can still be luxurious \"This is part of our vision for urban mobility, for smart cities,\" says the company's chief designer, Laurens van den Acker. \"We think that this future is going to be increasingly autonomous, more connected and shared. That means you won't own a car any more. But you will be able to access a service. More Technology of Business Could chip fat help dirty shipping clean up its act? Sky battles: Fighting back against rogue drones How Amsterdam's canal boats are going electric - at a cost Why the laundry industry is in a spin to save water \"And you might, once in a while, want to enjoy a luxury experience.\" Part of the challenge seems to be to show that the car of the future can still be desirable. Peugeot, for example, has spent a year working on the e-Legend, a retro-styled coupe which harks back to a classic design of the 1960s and 1970s. The Peugeot e-Legend harks back to an earlier era but is packed full of the latest tech A throwback on the outside, but thoroughly futuristic on the inside, it is a vision of how an electric sports car - with self-driving as an option - could still get pulses racing. \"Just because we will be integrating a lot of technology with electric and autonomous cars, that doesn't mean the overall experience has to be cold and unemotional,\" says head of design Matthias Hossan. No-one can say for sure where exactly the car industry is heading. But by allowing designers to let their imaginations run free, carmakers can at least start to prepare themselves for an uncertain future - and gain some good publicity into the bargain.

Mr Netanyahu, who won elections in November, is set to serve an historic sixth term as prime minster. His coalition contains far-right parties, including one whose leader was once convicted of anti-Arab racism. Palestinians fear the new government will also strengthen Israel's hold on the occupied West Bank. \"I have managed [to form a government],\" Mr Netanyahu tweeted, just minutes before a midnight local time (22:00 GMT) deadline set by the Israeli President, Isaac Herzog. It will take over from the outgoing centre-left caretaker government when it is sworn in, which is expected to happen next week. Mr Netanyahu's coalition partners reject the idea of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict - the internationally backed formula for peace which envisages an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank alongside Israel, with Jerusalem as their shared capital. The leader of the Religious Zionism party, which in alliance with two other far-right parties won the third largest number of seats in the knesset (parliament), wants to see Israel annex the West Bank and has been given wide powers over its activities there. Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 war. More than 600,000 Jewish settlers live in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The settlements they live in are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Israel pulled its settlers and troops out of the Gaza Strip in 2005. Palestinian fears heightened as far right heads to power Netanyahu election win propels far right to power Who is Benjamin Netanyahu? Israeli opposition politicians, as well as its attorney general, have warned that reforms planned by the incoming government - including giving MPs the right to overrule Supreme Court decisions - threaten to undermine Israeli democracy. Coalition partners have also proposed legal reforms which could end Mr Netanyahu's ongoing trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Mr Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing. Israeli opposition and civil rights groups have expressed particular alarm at the inclusion of the far-right in the new government. Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir is known for his anti-Arab comments and has called for the relaxation of rules on when security forces can open fire in the face of threats. Once convicted of incitement to racism and supporting a terror organisation, he is set to become national security minister with authority over the police in Israel and the West Bank. The other far-right partner in government, Avi Maoz of the anti-LGBT Noam party, has called for Jerusalem's Gay Pride event to be banned, disapproves of equal opportunities for women in the military, and wants to limit Jewish immigration to Israel to those defined as such according to Jewish religious law. Mr Netanyahu has accused critics of fearmongering and has vowed to preserve the status quo. \"I'll have two hands firmly on the steering wheel,\" he told US broadcaster NPR last week . \"I won't let anybody do anything to LGBT or to deny our Arab citizens their rights or anything like that, it just won't happen.

Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images For the past four years, the federal government embraced the idea that a more diverse, inclusive workforce would better serve the American people. Now, with the stroke of his pen, President Trump has abruptly reversed course. On Monday, Trump issued an executive order terminating \"illegal DEI and 'diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility' (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government, under whatever name they appear.\" A second executive order issued Tuesday revokes numerous executive actions of administrations past, including some that had been in effect for decades. One issued by former President Bill Clinton required federal agencies to address environmental justice for low-income and minority populations. Another signed by former President Lyndon B. Johnson required government contractors to adopt nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and employment. Sponsor Message Even as Trump's critics decry the moves, federal agencies are getting to work carrying out his vision. Business Trump seeks to end telework for federal workers Agencies ordered to put DEIA employees on paid leave On Tuesday, U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) acting director Charles Ezell sent a memo to agency leaders ordering them to place all employees of DEIA offices on paid administrative leave no later than 5 p.m. Wednesday. Agencies were also told to send agency-wide notices \"asking employees if they know of any efforts to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language.\" OPM provided a template for these notices that included an email address for reporting such efforts and a warning that failure to do so may result in \"adverse consequences.\" Additionally, agencies were directed to take down websites and social media accounts, cancel trainings and terminate any contractors related to DEIA work. By noon Thursday, agencies are to submit to OPM a complete list of DEIA offices and anyone who was working in those offices as of Nov. 5, 2024, the date of the presidential election. Agencies are required to submit a written plan by Jan. 31 for layoffs of those working in DEIA offices, the memo says. Politics Some Trump voters express reservations with his sweeping Jan. 6 pardons It wasn't immediately clear how many federal employees will be laid off. \"Given the broad brush that they have painted, it's potentially very large numbers of people,\" says Rob Shriver, acting head of OPM under former President Joe Biden. Shriver, who's now managing director of Civil Service Strong at the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward, sees the move as part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to sideline career employees in favor of political loyalists. Under Biden, a massive scale-up of DEIA work In fact, DEIA programs exist throughout the federal government because of a series of executive actions taken by Biden. Sponsor Message His administration called on federal agencies to recruit more job candidates from underserved communities, run training programs advancing principles of equity and inclusion, and address pay inequities, among other steps. Agencies created new positions to oversee the work. Longtime DEIA consultant Alaysia Black Hackett, who served as chief diversity and equity officer at the Labor Department, says a common misperception is that the work is only about race. \"A lot of what we did in DEIA, specifically at the Labor Department, was to ensure that we were creating pathways to good paying jobs,\" she says. \"Our strategy was to build an economy for all workers.\" Public Health Federal health agencies told to halt all external communications Sometimes the work involved figuring out which communities could benefit from more training opportunities or apprenticeships. Other times it involved simplifying government documents to ensure farmworkers in the South fully understood their rights and were paid correctly and provided adequate breaks. \"It's not just something that we morally do, but it actually helps with the economic prosperity of our country,\" says Hackett. Prior to serving in the federal government, Hackett led diversity and inclusion work in the office of former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. Both experiences have sharpened her belief that government needs to reflect the country that America is today. \"When you think about who was in the room during the creation of the Constitution of the United States of America, there was one vantage point, one lens, which was white male men,\" she says. Facing penalties for faithfully doing their jobs Hackett, a political appointee, left her post at the end of the Biden administration. She believes anywhere from a couple dozen to more than a hundred employees still at the Labor Department could be affected by Trump's executive order. Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, condemned the developments unfolding this week. Sponsor Message \"Penalizing career civil servants for faithfully doing their jobs during a prior administration is wrong,\" he wrote in a statement. \"The affected employees are everyday people who have to support themselves and their families, and the abrupt and rushed approach chosen here will have a traumatizing impact on not just them but their colleagues who remain in their roles serving the public, as well.\" DEI federal workers Trump's presidential transition diversity, equity and inclusion Facebook Flipboard Email Trump’s crackdown on DEIA programs within the federal government is underway Listen · 3:29 3:29 Transcript Toggle more options Download Embed Embed < iframe src=\"https://www.npr.org/player/embed/nx-s1-5271588/nx-s1-5335133-1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"290\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"NPR embedded audio player\"> Transcript",

The 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act already requires insurers and corporate-backed health plans to provide access and payment structures for mental health care services on par with other medical services.

That is partly due to a lack of mental health providers being sufficiently covered by insurance plans, leading patients to pay high out-of-pocket costs or to give up on care. \"The rule targets this network adequacy problem and recognizes that low pay for mental health providers is a major cause of network inadequacy,\" said Dr. Jared Skillings, chief of professional practice at the American Psychological Association.  · Scroll to continue \"While some insurance companies may claim network inadequacy is primarily due to a workforce shortage. We disagree.\" The final rule, proposed last summer, is aimed at closing the gaps by requiring health insurers to evaluate which mental health providers' services are covered by their plans, how much those providers are paid, as well as on how often they require or deny prior authorizations for coverage. Where needed, such requirements may push health plans to add mental health providers to networks, according to a senior administration official. Most of the new regulation will take effect in 2026. Patients enrolled in private health plans paid an average $1,500 per year in out-of-pocket costs for mental health care, White House domestic policy adviser Neera Tanden said in a briefing. Often that is because they seek coverage from out-of-network providers, she said.

The Department of Labor regulates corporate-sponsored health plans under the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. The ERISA Industry Committee, a trade council representing U.S. employers sponsoring large health plans, in October submitted comments to the Department of Labor, arguing that the rule would create an additional cost burden for employer-sponsored health plans and increase healthcare costs for enrollees. In a statement on Monday, the committee said the potential impact of the change is concerning and goes far beyond what Congress intended in its laws. \"We will consider all possibilities to prevent further harm to employers offering behavioral health benefits, and the employees and families who count on them, up to and including litigation,\" Melissa Bartlett, senior vice president of health policy for the committee, said in a statement.

                "content": "Should we drink milk to strengthen bones? 9 April 2019 Share Save Claudia Hammond Features correspondent Share Save Getty Images For generations, we’ve been told milk helps build strong bones. But does science back this up? How many of us were told as children to drink our milk because it would give us strong bones? The idea does make some sense. Milk contains calcium. Calcium is known to improve bone mineral density. But demonstrating a definitive link between the consumption of milk and the possession of strong bones is harder than it sounds. The ideal study would take two large groups of people and randomly assign every member of one group to drink plenty of milk daily for several decades, while the other group would drink some kind of milk placebo instead. Obviously, this is too difficult to do in practice. You might also like:  Why humans have evolved to drink milk How did milk become a staple food? Five myths about broken bones What we can do instead is to take many thousands of people, ask them how much milk they’ve been drinking over the years, and then follow them for at least a decade to see whether the people who regularly drink milk are any less likely to suffer from broken bones later in life. This is what happened in research published in 1997 conducted by Harvard University. An impressive 77,000 female nurses were followed for 10 years. The researchers found no significant difference in the numbers of arm or hip fractures between those who drank one glass of milk a week or less and those who drank two or more. Getty Images People often underestimate the amount of milk they consume, forgetting what they add to coffee or cereal (Credit: Getty Images) When the team did a similar study with 330,000 male health professionals, again milk didn’t seem to make a difference to fracture rates . Randomised control trials have been conducted in which the diet is deliberately fortified with calcium, sometimes through drinking milk. In 2015 a team in New Zealand reviewed, combined and reanalysed 15 of these studies. They found that for two years there was an increase in the bone mineral density , but that after that time the increase stopped. Drinking a glass of milk a day appeared to be associated both with more broken bones, and with early deaths An alternative is to take calcium supplements. Following fears of the risk of long-term side effects from taking the supplements, the same team in New Zealand combined the data from 51 randomised controlled trials to assess whether the benefits outweighed any risks. Again, they found that the increase in bone strength stops after a year or two, and that calcium supplements could only slow down –­­­­rather than halt – the loss of bone mineral density in old age. They concluded that this was likely to translate only to a small reduction in terms of fracture rates. When different countries have examined the same data, they have come to very different conclusions about their recommended daily intake of calcium. The US, for example, recommends almost twice as much the UK or India. In the US, the guideance has been for people to drink three 8oz (227ml) glasses a day. Getty Images Studies have thrown up condusing findings regarding whether milk helps protect bones or not (Credit: Getty Images) To confuse things further, in 2014 came the results of two large Swedish studies which led to headlines that drinking more than three glasses of milk a day – a larger amount that most people drink – was no help to your bones and might even harm you. For that study, researchers at Uppsala University and the Karolinska Institute gave people questionnaires about their milk consumption in 1987 and again in 1997. Mortality rates were examined in 2010. People were alarmed to hear that drinking a glass of milk a day appeared to be associated both with more broken bones, and with early deaths. Milk probably does have benefits for bone health, albeit benefits which are shorter lived than you might have hoped But before we chuck away the milk, there are some big caveats. In the Swedish studies, participants were required to estimate their milk consumption during the previous years , which is no easy task. It’s hard to know how much you eat with cereal, or in tea or in cooking. The study also throws up the perennial problem of correlation versus causation. Perhaps women who knew they had osteoporosis deliberately drank more milk in the hope of strengthening their bones. The study didn’t show that drinking milk was definitely causing the fractures. And to complicate the picture further, the Swedish team found that cheese and yoghurt consumption was associated with lower fracture rates. Getty Images Swedish studies have shown that yoghurt consumption is linked to lower rates of bone breaks (Credit: Getty Images) The researchers themselves made it clear that their study would need to be replicated before it was used to give dietary advice. Others said the public should be cautious about changing their consumption based on these results . So until we know more, the current weight of evidence suggests that it is still OK to continue to drink milk if you like it. It probably does have benefits for bone health, albeit benefits which are shorter lived than you might have hoped. It’s also worth keeping your bones strong through other methods such as exercise and getting enough vitamin D from your diet, from sunshine or (depending on where in the world you live) from supplements in winter.

The government weathered a three-hour monsoon of questions in the Commons on Tuesday, which amounted to MP after MP asking why on earth Lord Mandelson was appointed as our man in Washington in the first place, and then why it took so long for Sir Keir Starmer to realise his position was untenable. Today they can hope, if only briefly, the questions of who knew what and when and the questions about Sir Keir's abilities to do his job can be dislodged from our screens. After all, President Trump craves the best pictures and pictures are what any state visit are (pretty much) all about. The next few days amount to the UK offering a vital ally the full works of what he loves: royalty, military bands, a flypast, a banquet and plenty more besides. It is the latest point in the arc of the unlikely friendship between Sir Keir and the president, almost exactly a year after they first met at Trump Tower in New York, before the American election. LIVE: Follow the latest from Trump's state visit to UK What is the president doing during his visit? America's unofficial party house where presidents stay in London WATCH: BBC correspondents on relationship between PM and president Security measures - from anti-drones and decoys to bringing in The Beast The rhetoric is already flying higher than the planes that will zoom over Windsor Castle later. The British embassy in Washington may not currently have an ambassador, but it is still in possession of superlatives. \"The UK-US relationship is the strongest in the world, built on 250 years of history,\" it claims. The prime minister's official spokesman added that the next 48 hours would see an \"unbreakable friendship reach new heights\". Many, including his political opponents, acknowledge that the prime minister can chalk up as a triumph his relationship with President Trump. But it is also true that the relationship remains a rollercoaster and will always be one. Sir Keir wants to lean into the economic wins the UK-US relationship can bring. The latest announcement from Microsoft is a case in point. But the news about tariffs on UK steel remaining in place is a case in point about that unpredictability. Officials say the state visit created an impetus for both sides in recent months to chivvy commercial deals along so both sides had wins they could announce to their domestic audiences during the visit. Thursday will be the more explicitly political day. The news conference will be another wild ride of uncertainty for the prime minister, because as senior government figures frequently acknowledge, it is impossible to be certain what the president might end up saying. And beyond the likely warm words, there are disagreements or at least different emphases on a wide range of issues: the UK's imminent recognition of a Palestinian state, the war in Ukraine and, yes, Jeffrey Epstein. Questions about the convicted sex offender, who died six years ago, look likely to follow the president over the Atlantic, courtesy of the made-in-Britain-row about Epstein and Lord Mandelson. As the president enjoys 48 hours in the land of his mother and is the guest of royalty, the noise of controversy from back home may yet greet him – all thanks to the row that has been happening here.

                "content": "Five ways science can improve your focus 25 September 2017 Share Save Caroline Williams Features correspondent Share Save Anyone who has tried to concentrate on a difficult or boring piece of work will know how tough it can be, but science has some counter-intuitive findings that could help. The internet is bursting with advice on how to concentrate amid a sea of distractions. But many of them are either wildly unrealistic or leave you out of the office loop and distracted by thoughts of what you might be missing. How many of us can “ always find what you do inspiring and fun ” or would be comfortable turning off social media , spending the day wearing headphones , or working offline ? Many tips bear little relation to what psychologists are discovering about the way the human mind works Perhaps more importantly, however, many of these tips bear little relation to what psychologists are discovering about the way the human mind works. Many of the things we think we should be doing to help us concentrate actually work against the way that our brain naturally operates. So what can we learn from the science of focus to get more done, and do any of common tips actually work? Zone out It might seem counter-intuitive, but allowing your mind to wander may be one of the best approaches if you are struggling to focus. There is a growing realisation among psychologists that we spend an awful lot of time daydreaming – almost 50% of the time by some measures. This has led some psychologists to suggest that mind wandering is not so much a glitch, but rather a key part of the system itself that can help our brains function. Alamy If you spend half your time daydreaming, it might be an idea to schedule in time for it (Credit: Alamy) Looking at the brain itself can help to reveal that our focus wanes for a good reason. Concentration requires a network of brain regions including the frontal cortex, which is responsible for resisting distractions and controlling our natural impulse to do something more fun. Keeping this network functioning requires more energy than the group of brain regions that are active when we are thinking about nothing in particular. Inevitably, at some point during the day, we run out of steam and that’s when mind wandering kicks in. People who are better at staying on task tend to do their daydreaming at times when it doesn&rsquo;t matter So if it’s going to happen, then why not schedule it at a convenient time? Paul Seli, a psychologist at Harvard University, has distinguished between deliberate and accidental mind wandering , and says that only the accidental kind is bad for getting stuff done. People who slot in their daydreaming when they know that it won’t matter – when doing mindless admin, for example, suffer less than those whose minds skip off without their say-so, says Seli. “If the task is easy, intentionally mind wandering will likely not result in performance costs, but it should afford people the opportunity to reap the benefits of mind wandering, such as problem-solving and planning,” he says. This suggests that deliberately letting your mind off the hook now and again might pay dividends. “Think about something unrelated, maybe problem-solve something else that you've got on your mind and then come back to your task,” suggests Seli. Giving yourself permission to think about anything but work not only takes the guilt out of mind wandering, it also helps tick a few things off the mental to-do list that caused the mind wandering in the first place. Muck about Alamy One study recommended workplaces should encourage a more “playful” culture – mandated cat video breaks, perhaps? (Credit: Alamy) Funny cat videos are often seen as the ultimate distraction for procrastinators, but some psychologists think that they might actually help put us in the right mental state to get on with work. According to a recent study, a good way to boost your reserves of willpower is to have a good laugh This is because, no matter how much you love your job, staying focused on something difficult requires willpower. According to a recent study, a good way to boost your reserves of willpower is to have a good laugh. In experiments, people who had watched a funny video tried longer and harder to complete an impossible puzzle than a control group of people who watched a video that was relaxing but not funny. The study concluded that humour replenishes our reserves so effectively that workplaces should encourage a more “playful” culture. “Creating a culture of fun in your team – where you deliberately find something funny to laugh at, like a funny email or YouTube video would be one way of helping you to boost your work productivity,” says David Cheng, a leadership researcher at the Australia National University in Canberra, who led the research. “Of course this isn’t a blank cheque to watch cat videos all day, but taking the occasional break to joke around is useful, especially when you are feeling really tired.” Make it harder To concentrate properly you must get rid of all external distractions, right? Actually, according to one influential theory of attention, the opposite is true. Nilli Lavie, a psychologist at University College London, came up with what she calls ‘Load Theory’ in 1995 . The idea is that there is a limit to how much information from the outside world our brains can process at any one time – once all of these processing ‘slots’ have been filled, the brain’s attention system kicks in to decide what to focus on. Alamy Can’t see your desk under all the mess? Lavie’s experiments suggest you’re onto something (Credit: Alamy) Lavie’s experiments suggest we might be better to work not in clean, tidy and silent surroundings, but in those that are messy and confusing. It works because once all the perceptual slots have been taken up, the brain has to pour all its energies into focusing on the most important task. Distractions simply get screened out. The problem with putting this into practice, however, is finding the right kind of distraction and keeping it on the right side of being overwhelming. There are a few apps, such as ommwriter or focus@will , that add visual or musical distractions to order, but so far none have been tested in scientific studies and may be no better than putting the radio on. The key is to give your mind just enough to do, so that your brain doesn't have the chance to look elsewhere for stimulation. For most people it might be a case of trial and error to find what works for them, but since screening out distractions can be tiring, perhaps this is one to use sparingly, when all else has failed. Stop working When you’re up against it, taking a break might be the last thing on your mind. But there is a huge amount of evidence to suggest it can actually help you get more done. The challenge is working out when to take a break, for how long, and what to do with that downtime. Some studies suggest that due to natural variations in our cycle of alertness, we can concentrate for no longer than 90 minutes before needing a 15-minute break Some studies dating from the 1990s suggest that due to natural variations in our cycle of alertness, we can concentrate for no longer than 90 minutes before needing a 15-minute break. Other studies have found that even a micro-break of a few seconds will work, provided it is a total distraction – in the studies, people did a few seconds of mental arithmetic, so you may have to do something more intense than staring out of the window. Getty Images For those who can unglue themselves from their keyboards, a lunchtime jog outdoors could do the trick (Credit: Getty Images) Exercise is a good thing to do in with your break, as it seems to rev up the brain , putting it into a better state to knuckle back down, particularly, according to this study , if you follow it with a caffeinated drink. Take your exercise outdoors and get a further boost – spending time in nature has long been suspected to improve people’s ability to focus. Meditation is another option. There is growing evidence that experienced meditators have better control over their attention resources than non-meditators and are much better at noticing when it’s time for a break. If that all sounds a bit time-consuming, the good news is that, with or without exercise, a quick dose of caffeine improves memory, reaction time and attention in the short term. So however you choose to take your break, always stop to put the kettle on as you make your way back to your desk. Alamy Exercise not your thing? Caffeine can provide a short-term solution (Credit: Alamy) Don’t try so hard When you need to focus for long periods, less is more, according to studies by Joe DeGutis and Mike Esterman at the Boston Attention and Learning Lab in Massachusetts. In brain imaging experiments, they found that the most successful strategy for staying on course was to focus for a while, and then to take a short break before going back to concentrating. People who tried to be ‘on’ all the time made more mistakes overall. The more we know about the brain, the clearer it is that stress is the enemy of concentration Similarly, research by Christian Olivers of Vrije University in Amsterdam found that people’s attention resources stretched a little bit further when they were simply told to back off and think about something else instead of concentrating fully. This, in fact, may be the most useful outcome of all the research into focus. The more we know about the brain, the clearer it is that stress is the enemy of concentration . So take the time to do whatever it takes to feel calmer and more in control, and, with luck, the work will take care of itself.

                "content": "Combative Trump blames diversity policies after air tragedy 31 January 2025 Share Save Anthony Zurcher North America correspondent Share Save Watch: Trump speculated that diversity policies were factor in plane crash - but provided no evidence Donald Trump stood before the White House press room cameras on Thursday to perform a traditional presidential duty – consoler-in-chief during a time of tragedy. He said the country was in mourning, shared his condolences during \"an hour of anguish\" and paid tribute to first responders and the victims. Then he sharply pivoted - providing yet another reminder of how his new presidency is going to be very different. It will be combative. It will be unscripted. And it will be quick to point the finger of blame. \"We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas,\" he said. He then speculated, without giving evidence, that lowered standards of hiring for air traffic controllers in the Federal Aviation Administration during the Joe Biden and Barack Obama presidencies may have been a factor in the disaster. LIVE UPDATES: Get the latest on the crash investigation US and Russian figures skaters were on board plane Trump and his fellow Republicans have regularly attacked \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" programmes in the federal government. His team has made undoing such programmes a core part of their first days in office, saying they have divided Americans and weakened the country. And less than 24 hours after the first major US air disaster in more than a decade, Trump – along with his secretaries of transportation and defence, and his vice-president – took turns hammering their point, even as they provided no evidence that federal hiring practices had any connection to this particular crash. Asked by a reporter how he could blame diversity programmes for the crash when the investigation had only just begun, the president responded: \"Because I have common sense.\" At other moments, he acknowledged there was no confirmed cause, saying \"it's all under investigation\". But some of Trump's fellow Republicans thought he spoke too soon. \"I'd have to see if the evidence is substantiated,\" Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina told The Independent. \"It seems a bit early to me when I think that statement was made before we even have a flight data recorder.\" A number of disabilities rights groups including the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) issued a joint statement calling Trump's comments \"irresponsible, disparaging, and wrong\". \"The president is deliberately spreading falsehoods to demonize the quarter of American adults who live with disabilities rather than directing federal resources towards ensuring such a devastating tragedy never happens again,\" said AAPD president Maria Town. BBC Verify analyses the moments before the Washington DC plane crash Trump said the hiring guidance for the FAA's diversity and inclusion programme included preference for those with disabilities involving \"hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism\". An archived version of a website for the FAA's diversity and inclusion hiring programme that appears to have been taken down in December included a similar list. The agency was seeking people with \"targeted disabilities\" that the federal government was prioritising for recruitment at the time. But it's unclear how that drive to make recruitment more diverse may have impacted the ranks of air traffic controllers, who President Trump said needed to all be \"naturally talented geniuses\". The FAA has more than 35,000 employees, only a fraction of which perform that role. In response to criticisms over diversity hiring practices last year, the agency released a statement asserting that all new hires must meet \"rigorous qualifications\" that \"vary by position\". The agency has faced criticism over a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic caused massive disruptions in commercial air travel. Reports suggest that staffing levels at Reagan airport on Wednesday night may have been compromised. In his remarks, Trump specifically blamed Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whom he described with an obscenity and said had ran the department \"into the ground\". Buttigieg defended his record on social media, calling Trump's comments \"despicable\". \"As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying,\" he said. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also criticised Trump's comments. \"It's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracies, it's another for the President of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered,\" Schumer said. Once he departed from his prepared remarks, however, speculation was what President Trump seemed most interested in offering. Along with his condemnation of DEI policies, he offered extended discussion of the angles and elevation at which the two aircraft were flying, the weather conditions on Wednesday night, the temperature of the Potomac and the behaviour of the Army helicopter. \"We had a situation where we had a helicopter that had an ability to stop,\" he said. \"For some reason, it just kept going.\" But on Thursday evening, the White House doubled down on blaming his predecessor and DEI policies. The president signed a memorandum to end diversity efforts in the aviation sector and to review all hiring decisions and changes to safety protocols made during the Biden administration. He also signed an executive order to appoint a new head of the FAA. Two things were very clear from Trump's remarks on Thursday. The first is that his eagerness to inject himself into a major news story is undiminished in his new term. And the second is that in his view it is never too soon to inject politics into national tragedy – and use it to attack opponents and advance his agenda.

(Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/ Getty) We know that climate change is caused by human activity, but pinning down exactly who is responsible is trickier than it might seem. One of the most frustrating things about the climate crisis is that the fact that earlier action could have prevented it. With every passing year of inaction, the emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to relatively safe levels grow steeper and steeper. Many groups have been accused of being at blame for this ongoing lack of action, from fossil fuel companies and wealthy countries , to politicians , rich people and sometimes even all of us . Others may feel it’s not useful to blame anyone. “If you want to engage with the non-converted and get them to want stronger climate action, blaming them is not going to be a very fruitful pathway,” says Glen Peters, research director of the Center for International Climate and Environment Research in Oslo. Whether we label it blame or not, the question of who is responsible for the climate crisis is a necessary one. It will inevitably impact the solutions we propose to fix things. But it’s also important to acknowledge that allocating emissions to someone – the extractors of fossil fuels, the manufacturers who make products using them, the governments who regulate these products, the consumers who buy them – does not necessarily mean saying they are responsible for them. You might also like: How flight shame is changing travel How we mourn a changing planet The wild places that heal climate burnout For example, many people across the world lack access to a steady, clean electricity supply and instead use high-emission diesel generators to generate electricity. You can allocate these emissions to the people using the generators, but it is hard to say they are to blame for them. “You’re just slicing through the system at one end of the supply chain versus the other,” says Julia Steinberger, professor of ecological economics at the University of Leeds. “That alone is not enough to allocate blame.” Seventy percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions over the previous two decades are attributable to just 100 fossil fuel producers What examining each of these links of the supply chain does do, however, is allow us to understand this complex system differently, she adds. But ultimately what is important is understanding who holds the power over the choices available to everyone else. By challenging how, and for whom, that power is gained and used, perhaps we can begin to shed light on how to truly turn things around on climate. Fossil fuel companies Fossil fuel firms clearly play a major role in the climate problem. A major report released in 2017 attributed 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions over the previous two decades to just 100 fossil fuel producers. An update last year outlined the top 20 fossil fuel firms behind a third of emissions. B ut it is not only through their ongoing extraction of fossil fuels that these companies have had such a huge impact on climate action. They have also worked hard to shape the public narrative. In 2015, an investigation by US website Inside Climate News revealed that the oil firm Exxon knew about climate change for decades and led efforts to block measures to cut emissions. Revelations like this have contributed to strong public anger at fossil fuels firms. Many now think that such companies have said and done everything they could to be able to continue extracting and burning fossil fuels – no matter the cost. Javier Hirschfeld/Getty A tiny proportion of firms are responsible for the lion's share of carbon emissions (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty) Amy Westervelt is a climate journalist who has spent years exploring the thinking behind big oil’s strategy over the past decades, most recently in her podcast Drilled . She says there was a point in the late 1970s when oil companies in the US like Exxon appeared to be embracing renewables and increasingly viewing themselves energy companies, rather than just oil companies. But this mindset had changed completely by the early 1990s due to a series of oil crises and changing leadership, she says. “There was this real sort of shift in mindset from ‘If we have a seat at the table, we can help to shape the regulations,’ to ‘We need to stop any kind of regulation happening.’” Fossil fuel firms have since done “a great job” of making any kind of environmental concerns seem elitist, adds Westervelt. For example, Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chief executive who went on to be US secretary of state, repeatedly argued that cutting oil use to fight climate change would make poverty reduction harder . “They have this talking point that they've been trotting out since the 1950s, that if you want to make that industry cleaner in any way, then you’re basically unfairly impacting the poor. Never mind that the costs don’t actually have to be offloaded on to the public.” At the same time, fossil fuel companies have long employed PR tactics in a bid to control the narrative around climate change, says Westervelt, pushing doubts about the science and working to influence how people understand the role of fossil fuels in the economy. “They have put a real emphasis on creating materials for social studies, economics and civics classes that all centre the fossil fuel industry,” says Westervelt. “I think there’s a real lack of understanding about just how much that industry has shaped how people think about everything, and very deliberately so.” A small group of scientists with links to right-wing think tanks and industry have for decades distorted public debate by sowing doubt on well-established scientific knowledge in the US, including on climate, according to Merchants of Doubt , the 2010 exposé by historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway. “Ever since scientists first began to explain the evidence that our climate was warming – and that human activities were probably to blame – people have been questioning the data, doubting the evidence and attacking the scientists who collect and explain it,” they write. Javier Hirschfeld/Getty Scientific evidence that emissions from human activity would cause climate change has a surprisingly long history (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty) It’s also worth remembering that the very concept of a personal carbon footprint was popularised by a wide-reaching 2005 BP media campaign . “It was the most brilliant example of ‘It’s your fault, not ours,’” says Westerwelt. “It's a framework that serves them really well because they can just say ‘Oh well, if you really care then why are you driving an SUV?’” Rich people Concentrating on the influence of fossil fuel companies in the failure to reduce emissions means focusing on where the supply chain starts and the push to keep extracting fossil fuels. But we can also look at where it ends – the people who consume the final products from fossil fuels, and, more specifically, those who consume a fair bit more than the rest. Across 86 countries, the richest 10% of people consume around 20 times more energy than the poorest 10% A recent international study from the University of Leeds calculated that, across 86 countries, the richest 10% of people consume around 20 times more energy than the poorest 10% . A big portion of this heightened consumption by richer people is through transport, the study found: flights, holidays and big cars driven long distances. So do studies like this lay the blame for climate change at the doors of rich consumers ? Yes and no, says Steinberger, who co-authored the paper. Yes, because rich people do have far more choice in how they spend their money. “If you’re rich enough to afford a big car, you’re also rich enough not to afford a big car. If the lifestyles that rich people choose to lead are very ostentatious and wasteful, they definitely have responsibility over this,” says Steinberger. Rich people also tend to be more influential in government and in the companies driving government policy, she says. “In general, if we're talking about who has the power to make decisions, it's probably rich people in different roles.” But also no, says Steinberger, because even high consumers live within a system that enables, and even rewards, their consumption. Javier Hirschfeld/Getty People with high-carbon lifestyles live in a broader system that encourages consumption (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty) Recent events have helped put the impact of individual action into perspective. Even at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in April, with many countries in lockdown, daily global CO2 emissions fell 17% compared with 2019 levels . The drop is certainly major – emissions were temporarily comparable to 2006 levels – but the fact it was not even more gives an insight into how much deeper emissions cuts need to go than the lifestyle changes available to individual people. The real importance of studies showing individual carbon footprints is not to point the blame at certain consumers, but to shed a light on the best way to make policies to cut emissions. For example, says Steinberger, it would be foolish to expect to drive decarbonisation of people’s homes on the basis of taxes, because home energy is a basic good that everyone needs. Large-scale public investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency would make more sense, she says. On the other hand, taxing the luxury products rich people tend to disproportionately overconsume, such as flights, does make sense, she adds. Rich countries Widening out the frame from individual consumption, another way climate blame is often apportioned is by looking at which countries emit the most. The question of whether richer, historically more polluting countries should take more responsibility for climate change than others has long been a sore point at international climate negotiations. Back in 1992, when the first international climate treaty was signed to set up a framework for future climate negotiations, it included an important – and yet, to some, still contentious – principle. The treaty acknowledged that countries had different historic responsibilities for emissions, as well a s varying abilities to reduce them going forwards. Addressing climate change requires urgent action by all people certainly, including rich and poor, but with wealthy countries taking the lead – Mohamad Adow The world’s richest countries have released the vast majority of emissions, and many continue to emit many times more than poorer ones. The US has emitted far more CO2 than any other country: a quarter of all emissions since 1751 have occurred there. Despite China’s huge rise in emissions over the past decade, emissions per person still sit at less than half those of the US, while the one billion people living in Sub-Saharan Africa each emit one-twentieth of the average person in the US. Javier Hirschfeld/Getty A quarter of all emissions since the Industrial Revolution have been in the US (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty) However, negotiations to divvy out the deep emissions cuts the world needs in a “fair” way have proven a political nightmare , with richer, more polluting countries backing out of strong commitments and talks falling through time and time again. Eventually, a different approach was developed: countries would sign up to a set of common, overarching climate goals, but self-assign their own emission reductions targets, based on whatever they felt able to promise. This was the approach taken in the 2015 Paris Agreement , where countries agreed to limit global temperature rise to “well below 2C” and strive to limit it to 1.5C, but refrained from setting out exactly who should do what to get there. The treaty recognises that reaching peak emissions will take longer for developing than developed countries, and sets up a system for ramping up country pledges over time . The problem is that wealthy countries still have an “emissions debt” to other countries due to their principal responsibility for climate change, argues Mohamed Adow, director of energy and climate think tank Power Shift Africa and a well-known voice at international climate conferences. Rich polluters should not only reduce their own emissions, but also deliver on promises of finance and technology to help poorer countries develop via a lower carbon path, says Adow, as well as supporting them to deal with climate impacts which are already locked in. “At the heart of an effective regime should be a fair process for sharing the effort between countries in a way that is sustainable,” says Adow. “Addressing climate change requires urgent action by all people certainly, including rich and poor, but with wealthy countries taking the lead.” However, Adow is still cautious about assigning blame to richer countries. “You wouldn't want to start with a frame of going out and blaming the US,” he says. “But you will go with a frame that allows you to talk about the Earth and atmosphere as shared global commons that should be fairly enjoyed by all, including the poor, future generations and all life.” Not all climate experts think more focus on assigning the fair share of emissions reduction to countries is the best way to ensure global emissions are cut. After all, this is the very strategy that has proven so difficult to negotiate in the past. “Basically, countries have to be seen by their peers to be doing enough, not necessarily to be perfect,” says Peters. “Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.” “Us” Whether or not you think emissions cuts should be negotiated internationally, few would argue against the need for richer countries to take more responsibility. So what does that mean for those of us living in these rich countries? Do we all need to take more responsibility for our countries’ emissions? Are we to blame for climate change? If you look at the system in a certain way, yes we are. For many of us, the products and energy we consume can be linked to a hefty – and unsustainable – portion of emissions. Javier Hirschfeld/Getty Some researchers argue that the idea of \"us\" being responsible for climate change is a confusing concept (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty) But it is crucial to also acknowledge that we are all part of a bigger system that not everyone is equally complicit in holding up. “The we responsible for climate change is a fictional construct, one that’s distorting and dangerous,” writes climate scholar and author Genevieve Guenther . “By hiding who’s really responsible for our current, terrifying predicament, [the pronoun] we provides political cover for the people who are happy to let hundreds of millions of other people die for their own profit and pleasure.” What Guenther is saying boils down to the question of who holds the power to create and change the systems that cause climate change. If you can only afford a home in an edge-of-town housing estate without access to public transport , is it really your fault for becoming dependent on a car ? “Just because you can allocate [emissions] to an entity or to a location in a supply chain, does not mean that the power of agency lies with that entity or that location in the supply chain,” says Steinberger. “If you’re thinking about these supply chains, are you going to say that final consumers actually have the final decision-making over everything that happens upstream? Who is actually taking the damaging decision?” Javier Hirschfeld/Getty The question of blame is a useful one to find the most effective and fairest solutions to climate change (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty) Power differences between countries also play a strong role in the outcomes of international climate talks, says Adow. “Sadly, the countries that have the greatest historical responsibility for climate change continue to have the greatest influence on the climate regime,” he says. “They are effectively abusing their power.” But even viewing climate inaction through this lens of power, those who have less of it can still act to confront it. Climate activist Greta Thunberg embodied this when in 2019 she told elites gathered in Davos that many of them were to blame for the climate crisis by sacrificing “priceless values” to “continue making unimaginable amounts of money”. As one academic essay puts it: “To a void [confronting] power is to risk condoning a system that is inherently unsustainable and unjust.” We may or may not feel that the blame for the climate crisis should be placed at someone’s door. But whether we call it blame or not, it is still crucial that we untangle the structures of power and decision-making that continue to promote climate inaction. Only by better understanding how to change these can we hope to make the emissions cuts we now need so badly. -- Jocelyn Timperley is a freelance climate change reporter.

                "content": "Rogue Russian pilot tried to shoot down RAF aircraft in 2022 14 September 2023 Share Save Jonathan Beale Defence correspondent Share Save EPA A Russian SU-27, like those pictured, released a missile near the RAF plane A Russian pilot tried to shoot down an RAF surveillance plane after believing he had permission to fire, the BBC has learned. The pilot fired two missiles, the first of which missed rather than malfunctioned as claimed at the time . Russia had claimed the incident last September was caused by a \"technical malfunction\". The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) publicly accepted the Russian explanation. But now three senior Western defence sources with knowledge of the incident have told the BBC that Russian communications intercepted by the RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft give a very different account from the official version. The RAF plane - with a crew of up to 30 - was flying a surveillance mission over the Black Sea in international airspace on 29 September last year when it encountered two Russian SU-27 fighter jets. The intercepted communications show that one of the Russian pilots thought he had been given permission to target the British aircraft, following an ambiguous command from a Russian ground station. However, the second Russian pilot did not. He remonstrated and swore at his wingman when he fired the first missile. The Rivet Joint is loaded with sensors to intercept communications. The RAF crew would have been able to listen in to the incident which could have resulted in their own deaths. The MoD will not release details of those communications. Responding to these new revelations an MoD spokesperson said: \"Our intent has always been to protect the safety of our operations, avoid unnecessary escalation and inform the public and international community.\" What really happened As the two Russian SU-27s approached the RAF spy plane, they received a communication from their ground station controller. One Western source told the BBC the words they received were to the effect of \"you have the target\". This ambiguous language was interpreted by one of the Russian pilots as permission to fire. The loose language appears to have shown a high degree of unprofessionalism by those involved, sources said. In contrast, Nato pilots use very precise language when asking for and receiving permission to fire. The Russian pilot released an air-to-air missile, which successfully launched but failed to lock on to its target, the BBC has been told. It was a miss, not a malfunction. Defence sources have told the BBC that a row then broke out between the two Russian pilots. The pilot of the second SU-27 did not think they had been given permission to fire. He is said to have sworn at his comrade, effectively asking him what he thought he was doing. Yet the first pilot still released another missile. We had been told that the second missile simply fell from the wing - suggesting the weapon either malfunctioned or that the launch was aborted. What the UK MoD said happened Three weeks later, the UK government confirmed the incident had taken place - after an explanation from the Russian Ministry of Defence called it a \"technical malfunction\". In a statement to MPs on 20 October, the then Defence Secretary Ben Wallace called it a \"potentially dangerous engagement\". But he accepted the Russian explanation, saying: \"We do not consider this incident to constitute a deliberate escalation on the part of the Russians, and our analysis concurs that it was due to a malfunction.\" Russian jet released missile near RAF aircraft What the US said happened However, a secret intelligence leak revealed that the US military spoke of what happened in more stark terms. In a raft of documents, published online by US airman Jack Teixera, the same incident was described as \"a near shoot-down\". \"The incident was far more serious than originally portrayed and could have amounted to an act of war,\" the New York Times reported. According to two US defence officials, the newspaper said, the Russian pilot had misinterpreted an order from the ground. The Russian pilot \"who'd locked on the British Aircraft, fired, but the missile did not launch properly.\" The newspaper also quoted an unnamed US defence official describing the incident \"as really, really scary\". In response to the leaked report of a \"near shoot-down\" the UK MoD issued another statement which added more fog than clarity. The MoD claimed a \"significant proportion of the content of these reports [from the documents] is untrue, manipulated or both\". Why the secrecy? There may be several reasons why the UK's MoD was reluctant to give the full details. First, the UK would not want to publicise the extent of its intelligence gathering and details of the intercepted communications. More importantly neither side wanted an escalation - one which could potentially draw a Nato member into military confrontation with Russia. But the incident does show, once again, how one mistake and miscalculation by one individual could spark a wider conflict. The MoD has now told the BBC that \"this incident is a stark reminder of the potential consequences of Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine.\" This is not the first time a reckless Russian pilot has targeted a Nato aircraft in international air space. In March earlier this year, a Russian jet brought down a US unmanned surveillance drone, also flying over the Black Sea. In that incident the Russian pilot was awarded a medal, but most experts agree it was down to luck rather than skill or judgement. It highlights serious questions about the discipline and professionalism of Russia's air force. Despite the near shoot down, the RAF has continued to conduct surveillance flights over the Black Sea - a testament to the courage of the crews who narrowly avoided a disaster. Since the incident, these RAF surveillance flights have been escorted by Typhoon fighter jets armed with air-to-air missiles. The UK is the only Nato ally to conduct crewed missions over the Black Sea.
