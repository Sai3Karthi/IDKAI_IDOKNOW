                "content": "What went wrong at Smile Direct Club? 23 December 2023 Share Save Natalie Sherman Business reporter, New York Share Save Getty Images Smile Direct Club served more than 2 million people before it went bust Mohammad Ahmad, a 17-year-old from New Jersey, signed up for Smile Direct Club in October, just a few weeks after the teeth straightening firm declared bankruptcy. He was enticed, he said, by a big discount on the company's invisible braces and assured that the financial problems wouldn't affect operations. But Mohammad never received the clear plastic aligners he was promised after the company shut down in December, leaving him, and thousands of customers like him, in the lurch. \"I basically got scammed,\" said Mohammad, who is still hoping for a refund of $1,000 (£788) from money he earns as a tutor. It was an ignominious end to the Tennessee-based business, which once had a market value of more than $8bn and had promised to disrupt traditional dentistry with lower cost, remotely- supervised care. The concept convinced more than two million customers. For Mohammad, who had already had braces, he just wanted to address some mild shifting that occurred after he failed to wear his retainer as instructed. But almost from its start, Smile Direct Club was defending itself from critics raising concerns about its practices. It was embroiled in legal battles with business groups representing traditional dentists and orthodontists, who said its remote treatment, often provided after customers mailed in impressions of their mouths they had taken at home, provided inadequate care, and accused the firm of misleading customers. Prominent investors, such as Hindenburg Research, which is known for betting against companies, had also voiced alarm, accusing Smile Direct Club of \"cutting corners\" and warning that it would \"wind up as a case study in why it's a bad idea to invest in a company that attempts to fit a complex, dangerous medical process onto a low-cost, high volume assembly line\". The company denied the allegations, deriding them as \"the latest in a stream of unevidenced and misleading attempts ... to thwart legitimate competition\". But it took the threat to its business seriously, moving aggressively to quash other negative reports. It threatened legal action against reporters, academics and forced unhappy customers to sign non-disclosure agreements to get a refund until a government lawsuit forced it to end the practice this year. The problems eventually caught up with Smile Direct Club, said Myron Guymon, president of the American Association of Orthodonists. Nasdaq The triumphant 2019 Nasdaq listing of Smile Direct Club proved to be the company's peak moment \"Orthodontics looks simple but it is a complex medical procedure and should start with an in-person exam and good diagnostic records,\" he said. Smile Direct Club executives did not respond to a request for comment. In its bankruptcy filing, the company traced its fall to familiar economic villains: the pandemic and rising prices, which it said had hurt its manufacturing operation, raised costs and squeezed its target customers. It also cited a $63m award a court ordered it to pay its arch-rival and former business partner Align Technology over a contract dispute. But Brandon Couillard, analyst at Jefferies, said that deeper issues were at play, noting that the cost of addressing reputational issues - not just about quality but also customer service - hurt its growth and forced the loss-making firm to spend too much on advertising. \"It's not hard to Google and find people who have had a bad experience,\" he said. \"As the business matured, people did become more aware of the brand and that wasn't always a positive experience.\" Smile Direct Club's triumphant 2019 listing on Nasdaq, the US stock market index, after a streak of explosive sales growth, proved it be the firm's peak moment. It raised more than $1bn and briefly transformed its young founders into billionaires. But sales soon started tumbling, falling from more than $750m in 2019 back to $470m last year. Advertising to win new customers consumed more than half of its revenues. Losses mounted. In September, when it filed for bankruptcy protection, the company had just $5m in cash and nearly $900m in debt. \"It was pretty clear that consumer interest in the brand had been eroding for some time,\" Mr Couillard said. Getty Images Critics of the company said in-person visits are important Investors later accused Smile Direct Club of omitting important information about its critics during its 2019 share sale, suing it for a breach of financial laws. But Sanjula Jain, chief research officer at healthcare analytics and research firm Trilliant Health, said Smile Direct Club's downfall is also a reminder of the limits to the market for remote health care, take-up of which her team has found has fallen in almost every area since the height of the pandemic. \"Consumer behaviours are not changing in the way that a lot of the market and virtual care providers want it to,\" she said. \"Will that change over time remains to be seen.\" University of Pennsylvania professor Anna Wexler, who has studied direct-to-consumer health firms, said she still sees a future in remote or partially remote orthodontic care, noting that younger generations especially are frustrated with the current health care options and looking for models that are more convenient and affordable. Her 2020 study of 470 customers who had received remote orthodontistry found that about 6% ended up having to return to a traditional doctor for follow-up treatment. But more than 87% were satisfied with their care, willing to accept imperfections for a lower cost. The study cautioned that Smile Direct Club's use of non-disclosure agreements might have skewed the responses. But Prof Wexler said said she had still expected it and other companies selling such treatment to embrace her findings. Instead, Smile Direct Club threatened legal action, accusing her team of inaccurately describing its process and defaming its business. \"I was shocked,\" she recalled, noting that her team had been careful not to identify companies by name. The clash - which has not been previously reported - ended with a letter to the editor. Prof Wexler said she was not sorry to see this particular business go, given its track record of trying to silence its critics. \"Maybe if they hadn't spent so much money on legal counsel they'd be in a better financial state,\" she said.

                "content": "Rogue Russian pilot tried to shoot down RAF aircraft in 2022 14 September 2023 Share Save Jonathan Beale Defence correspondent Share Save EPA A Russian SU-27, like those pictured, released a missile near the RAF plane A Russian pilot tried to shoot down an RAF surveillance plane after believing he had permission to fire, the BBC has learned. The pilot fired two missiles, the first of which missed rather than malfunctioned as claimed at the time . Russia had claimed the incident last September was caused by a \"technical malfunction\". The UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) publicly accepted the Russian explanation. But now three senior Western defence sources with knowledge of the incident have told the BBC that Russian communications intercepted by the RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft give a very different account from the official version. The RAF plane - with a crew of up to 30 - was flying a surveillance mission over the Black Sea in international airspace on 29 September last year when it encountered two Russian SU-27 fighter jets. The intercepted communications show that one of the Russian pilots thought he had been given permission to target the British aircraft, following an ambiguous command from a Russian ground station. However, the second Russian pilot did not. He remonstrated and swore at his wingman when he fired the first missile. The Rivet Joint is loaded with sensors to intercept communications. The RAF crew would have been able to listen in to the incident which could have resulted in their own deaths. The MoD will not release details of those communications. Responding to these new revelations an MoD spokesperson said: \"Our intent has always been to protect the safety of our operations, avoid unnecessary escalation and inform the public and international community.\" What really happened As the two Russian SU-27s approached the RAF spy plane, they received a communication from their ground station controller. One Western source told the BBC the words they received were to the effect of \"you have the target\". This ambiguous language was interpreted by one of the Russian pilots as permission to fire. The loose language appears to have shown a high degree of unprofessionalism by those involved, sources said. In contrast, Nato pilots use very precise language when asking for and receiving permission to fire. The Russian pilot released an air-to-air missile, which successfully launched but failed to lock on to its target, the BBC has been told. It was a miss, not a malfunction. Defence sources have told the BBC that a row then broke out between the two Russian pilots. The pilot of the second SU-27 did not think they had been given permission to fire. He is said to have sworn at his comrade, effectively asking him what he thought he was doing. Yet the first pilot still released another missile. We had been told that the second missile simply fell from the wing - suggesting the weapon either malfunctioned or that the launch was aborted. What the UK MoD said happened Three weeks later, the UK government confirmed the incident had taken place - after an explanation from the Russian Ministry of Defence called it a \"technical malfunction\". In a statement to MPs on 20 October, the then Defence Secretary Ben Wallace called it a \"potentially dangerous engagement\". But he accepted the Russian explanation, saying: \"We do not consider this incident to constitute a deliberate escalation on the part of the Russians, and our analysis concurs that it was due to a malfunction.\" Russian jet released missile near RAF aircraft What the US said happened However, a secret intelligence leak revealed that the US military spoke of what happened in more stark terms. In a raft of documents, published online by US airman Jack Teixera, the same incident was described as \"a near shoot-down\". \"The incident was far more serious than originally portrayed and could have amounted to an act of war,\" the New York Times reported. According to two US defence officials, the newspaper said, the Russian pilot had misinterpreted an order from the ground. The Russian pilot \"who'd locked on the British Aircraft, fired, but the missile did not launch properly.\" The newspaper also quoted an unnamed US defence official describing the incident \"as really, really scary\". In response to the leaked report of a \"near shoot-down\" the UK MoD issued another statement which added more fog than clarity. The MoD claimed a \"significant proportion of the content of these reports [from the documents] is untrue, manipulated or both\". Why the secrecy? There may be several reasons why the UK's MoD was reluctant to give the full details. First, the UK would not want to publicise the extent of its intelligence gathering and details of the intercepted communications. More importantly neither side wanted an escalation - one which could potentially draw a Nato member into military confrontation with Russia. But the incident does show, once again, how one mistake and miscalculation by one individual could spark a wider conflict. The MoD has now told the BBC that \"this incident is a stark reminder of the potential consequences of Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine.\" This is not the first time a reckless Russian pilot has targeted a Nato aircraft in international air space. In March earlier this year, a Russian jet brought down a US unmanned surveillance drone, also flying over the Black Sea. In that incident the Russian pilot was awarded a medal, but most experts agree it was down to luck rather than skill or judgement. It highlights serious questions about the discipline and professionalism of Russia's air force. Despite the near shoot down, the RAF has continued to conduct surveillance flights over the Black Sea - a testament to the courage of the crews who narrowly avoided a disaster. Since the incident, these RAF surveillance flights have been escorted by Typhoon fighter jets armed with air-to-air missiles. The UK is the only Nato ally to conduct crewed missions over the Black Sea.
