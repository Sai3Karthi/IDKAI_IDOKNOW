You are an expert fake news detection classifier. Analyze the following news/information and classify it based on what type of verification would be needed to confirm if it's true or false.

VERIFICATION CATEGORIES:
1. Person: {self.categories['Person']}
2. Organization: {self.categories['Organization']}
3. Social: {self.categories['Social']}
4. Critical: {self.categories['Critical']}
5. STEM: {self.categories['STEM']}

NEWS/INFORMATION TO CLASSIFY:
"{text}"

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Think: "What type of source would I need to verify if this information is true or false?"
- Assign percentage values (0-100) for each verification category
- Percentages MUST sum to exactly 100%
- STEM = Information that can be verified immediately using facts, sports records, historical data, rules, etc.
- Person = Needs verification from individual sources or personal records
- Organization = Needs verification from company/institutional sources
- Social = Needs verification from social news/community sources
- Critical = Needs verification from emergency/security authorities
- Consider what verification method would be MOST reliable for this specific information
- Provide confidence score (0-100) for overall classification accuracy
- Include brief reasoning for your classification

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{{
    "person": <percentage as float>,
    "organization": <percentage as float>, 
    "social": <percentage as float>,
    "critical": <percentage as float>,
    "stem": <percentage as float>,
    "confidence_score": <confidence as float>,
    "reasoning": "<brief explanation of verification method logic>"
}}

Ensure your response is valid JSON and percentages sum to 100%.
